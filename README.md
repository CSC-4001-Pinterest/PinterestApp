## Overview
### Description
This app will resemble Pinterest, but it will be targeted towards a differnt audience. The app will mainly target African American Males. Since Pinterest is used often by women, we felt that it was fitting to make something similar for men. 

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category: Social Media/Lifestyle**
- **Mobile: This app will be made for mobile devices but, it could be developed to be use on Computers/Laptops. This app's functionality would not be limited to mobile devices, but it may be easier to navigate on a mobile device.**
- **Story: Analyzes users interests, can connect them to other users with similar choices. You create your own boards for your personal purposes, and share your ideas with others.**
- **Market: African-American Males.**
- **Habit: This app could be used as often or unoften as the user wanted depending on how deep their social life is, and what exactly they're looking for.**
- **Scope: First we would start with grouping people based on their interest. This could be a great counterpart to Interest.**
